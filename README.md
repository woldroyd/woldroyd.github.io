## About Me
I love solving mysteries about our solar system and exoplanetary systems and discovering new worlds using orbital dynamics and large telescopes. Currently, I am a PhD Student at Northern Arizona University studying Astronomy and Planetary Science working with Professor Chad Trujillo. My dissertation is focused on the relationship between Extreme Trans-Neptunian Objects and a hypothesized distant giant planet in the outer solar system, Planet X, and on improving the efficiency of orbital characterization for directly imaged exoplanets.

As an undergraduate, I majored in Physics and Astronomy at Brigham Young University (with minors in Math, Geology, and Spanish) and worked with Professor Jani Radebaugh on modeling the thermally driven migration of meteorites buried in Antarctic ice. I also worked to determine precise orbits for the moons of the dwarf planet Haumea with Professor Darin Ragozzine and developed curriculum and equipment for undergraduate physics labs.

I also enjoy sharing my enthusiasm for astronomy with students through teaching, mentoring, and outreach. When I'm not working, I spend most of my time with my wife and two kids hiking, disc golfing, and playing board games.

## Research
My research is primarily focused on constraining planet location using orbital dynamics and observations. I am particularly interested in a hypothetical giant planet, Planet X, orbiting deep in the far reaches of our solar system. I recently published a [paper](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-3881/abfb6f) showing how Planet X can cause the outer solar system perihelion gap (an orbital feature of the most distant Trans-Neptunian Objects; TNOs) and I am currently working on applying the techniques I developed in that paper to constrain the orbit of Planet X. You can watch my presentation on this work from a recent conference here: [DDA 2021](https://vimeo.com/545351933).

I am also developing a technique for optimizing revisit cadences for directly imaged exoplanets. This will greatly reduce the observation time required to determine the orbits of these planets which will increase the time observatories (particularly next generation space telescopes) can spend characterizing these worlds for habitablty. A paper detailing the specifics of this work is in progress and you can see a conference abstract here: [AAS 2021](https://baas.aas.org/pub/2021n1i516p03/release/1). Additional projects I am involved with include: the DECam Ecliptic Exploration Project (DEEP, an observation survey set to discover thousands of new TNOs, [EPSC-DPS 2019](https://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EPSC-DPS2019/EPSC-DPS2019-395-1.pdf)); constraining the space weathering rate of asteroid families via spectral slope modeling; searching for surface features on large TNOs using the Large Binocular Telescope (PI); the Legacy Survey of Space and Time Solar System Science Collaboration (see white papers [1](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.07653.pdf) and [2](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.03584.pdf)); pecision astrometry of the near-Earth asteroid Dydimos, the target of NASA's Double Asteroid Redirect Test (DART) mission; and follow up observation for discoveries of new distant TNOs (e.g., [2018 VG18](https://minorplanetcenter.net/mpec/K18/K18Y14.html), the seconod most distant TNO discovered so far) and objects showing cometary activity (e.g., [2014 OG392](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/ab7dc6/pdf), an active Centaur).
