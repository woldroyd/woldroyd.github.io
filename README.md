## About Me
I love solving mysteries about our solar system and making new discoveries using orbital dynamics and large telescopes. Currently, I am a Research Fellow at [Katalyst Space Technologies](https://www.katalystspace.com/), a space startup based in Flagstaff, AZ, focused on satellite upgrades. I am also a Postdoctoral Researcher in [Astronomy and Planetary Science at Northern Arizona University](https://nau.edu/astronomy-and-planetary-science/) working with Professors Chad Trujillo and Cristina Thomas. I received my PhD from NAU and My dissertation was titled *Constraining Planet Location Through Gravitational Modeling* and focused on (1) the relationship between Extreme Trans-Neptunian Objects and a hypothesized distant giant planet in the outer solar system, Planet X; (2) improving the efficiency of orbital characterization for directly imaged exoplanets; and (3) exploring a population of active asteroids/comets called the Quasi-Hildas.

As an undergraduate, I majored in [Physics and Astronomy at Brigham Young University](https://physics.byu.edu/) (with minors in Math, Geology, and Spanish) and worked with Professor Jani Radebaugh on modeling the thermally driven migration of meteorites buried in Antarctic ice. I also worked to determine precise orbits for the moons of the dwarf planet Haumea with Professor Darin Ragozzine and developed curriculum and equipment for undergraduate physics labs.

I enjoy sharing my enthusiasm for astronomy with students through teaching, mentoring, and outreach. When I'm not working, I enjoy spending time with my wife and two kids hiking, disc golfing, and playing board games.

## Research
My research at Katalyst is primarily on orbital dynamics of Earth satellites as part of our Active Resident Space Object Characterization (ARC) software. At NAU, I am currently focused on studying active asteroids, a small group of asteroids (~50) that have tails and comae like comets. This work is in connection with the NASA Partner Citizen Science project *Active Asteroids*, where volunteers help us search for cometary activity in archival telescope images. Anyone can participate at [activeasteroids.net](http://activeasteroids.net/) and, so far, we have had thousands of volunteers make millions of classifications and over 20 discoveries! Here is a recent [paper](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/acfcbc/pdf) where I give details on one of our discoveries and here is a [overview paper](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-3881/ad1de2/pdf) of the *Active Asteroids* project.

I am also a a member of NASA's DART misson, where we hit an asteroid with a spacecraft to change its orbit. It worked great! With enough time to prepare, NASA could deflect dangerous ansteroids on colission courses for Earth. My part on the team was working with images from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) of during the impact. The observations were tricky becasue the asteroid system (Didymos-Dimorphos) was moving quickly across the sky and JWST had to move about 3 times faster than it was originally designed to go. Right now, I'm working on comparing the comet-like tail that was produced from the impact with tails on other active asteroids. Papers on our inital results from JWST and this comparison study are currently in preparation.

Additional projects I am involved in include: the DECam Ecliptic Exploration Project (DEEP, an observation survey set to discover thousands of new TNOs (see the first of 6 new papers from this project [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.03417.pdf)), searching for surface features on large TNOs using the Vatican Advanced Technology Telescope and the Large Binocular Telescope, preparation for the Vera C. Rubin observatory through the LSST Solar System Science Collaboration, studying ways of placing constraints on a hypothetical giant planet, Planet X, orbiting deep in the far reaches of our solar system (see my paper [here](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-3881/abfb6f)), and follow-up observation for discoveries of new distant TNOs (e.g., [2018 VG18](https://minorplanetcenter.net/mpec/K18/K18Y14.html), the second most distant TNO discovered so far).
